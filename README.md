The assembly code for the Atari depends on my MADS include library here: https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-Mads-Includes.  

The MADS 6502 assembler is here: http://http://mads.atari8.info

I generally build in eclipse from the WUDSN ide.  WUDSN can be found here: https://www.wudsn.com/index.php
